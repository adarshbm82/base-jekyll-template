SP Bala:
--------

At age 57, a former banker, decides to take up Chartered Accountancy undaunted.
He goes through the contours of Internship, toils upwards in the night for his
exams, battles with minds that are about 40 years younger than his; and in
January 2002, days before he turns 60, he becomes a CA! That’s S D Bala; the man
who proved that what could be imagined can be achieved.  
  
S D Bala holds the unique record of taking up chartered Accountancy at age 57
and qualifying at 60 and has authored a Book for Financial Management for Final
CA

P S Menon:
----------

A stockbroker who had passed his CA Intermediate examination in 1987 came back
nearly 20 years later to pursue his CA-Final. In his mid forties now, with a
profession to look after, he takes on the agony of the final examination and
there is ecstasy in the end.

R Balagangadharan:
------------------

If these stumped you,this one will make you drop your jaws. 69 years young R
Balagangadharan, partner at a top Chennai firm, registered for his ICWA and at
age 72 qualified as a Cost Accountant.

These men symbolized the spirit of “Yes we can.”

Amazing stories of grit and of determination; stories that symbolize the spirit
of “Yes We Can.” And I am sure there are more that have not yet been heard of.

CA spawns a web of exciting winners. The daughter of an auto driver, a widowed
home-maker, a young visually challenged lad, another fighting cerebral palsy, a
gentleman in his 40s, another in his late 50s and still another in his early 70s
– all crack the CA code. You also can.
